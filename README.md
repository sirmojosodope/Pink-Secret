This is a password generator IF that wasn't super clear enough. In this password generator which is infact a password generator, GENERATES a password at random. You may use Upeercase, lowercase, numbers, or Symbols.
 You can use 8 - 128 characters and generate a password for any account/ profile you have. The issues I encopuntered were more so the CSS styling and less of the JavaScript functionality. In the future, I will focus less on the functionality of my app and more so on the specfic requirements such as this README file and screenshotting an image and what not.
