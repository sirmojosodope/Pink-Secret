This is a password generator. In this password generator which is infact a password generator, GENERATES a password at random. You may use Upeercase, lowercase, numbers, or Symbols.
 You can use 8 - 128 characters and generate a password for any account/ profile you have. The issues I encopuntered were more so the CSS styling and less of the JavaScript functionality. In the future, I will focus on more features and more CSS elements to make it look nicer and therefore easier to use. A copy button perhaps?
